increased number of species
made discretized thetas.true in the same way as thetas.pot

My impression is that the extra groups jointly take up a large proportion and therefore make the estimates of theta poorer.

For this reason, run twice:
1) First, run with 5 to identify the true number of groups
2) Once the approximate number of groups has been identified, run again with the "true number of groups"

This approach does not work. We might have to forget estimating the number of groups altogether using the TSBP.

It seems that we get approximately the same result if:
a) we fit the model with 5 groups and try to estimate the number of groups
b) we fit the model with true number of groups (=3) and ignore the TSBP.

When using the TSBP prior, I had to modify v so that it was never equal to 1 or 0. As a result, the calculations of log prior probabilities might have been very off. Use Dirichlet(0.1) instead.
