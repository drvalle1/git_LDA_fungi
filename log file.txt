Am I being to ambitious in relation to what can be estimated? Even if I know z and breaks, the algorithm estimates theta and phi so so.

1) remove stick-breaking prior? Use stick-breaking construction of dirichlet(1) 
2) propose/accept all theta's for a location at once. Jump distrib is dirichlet at current values

Let's try to isolate the problem:

- phi is very well estimated if we know z,theta,breaks
- phi is badly estimated if we know theta (but don't know z,breaks)
- z,breaks badly estimated if we know theta and phi. It seems that it is very hard to move breaks and z's together (i.e., they are highly dependent on each other)

I will try to run this algorithm longer before giving up on this idea and moving back to work on the marginal model where the z's are integrated out
