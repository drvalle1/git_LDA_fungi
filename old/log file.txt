Am I being to ambitious in relation to what can be estimated? Even if I know z and breaks, the algorithm estimates theta and phi so so.

1) remove stick-breaking prior? Use stick-breaking construction of dirichlet(1) 
2) propose/accept all theta's for a location at once. Jump distrib is dirichlet at current values

Let's try to isolate the problem:

- phi is very well estimated if we know z,theta,breaks
- phi is badly estimated if we know theta (but don't know z,breaks)
- z,breaks badly estimated if we know theta and phi. It seems that it is very hard to move breaks and z's together (i.e., they are highly dependent on each other)
#---------------------------------------------------------
To break the interdependency between z and breaks, I will propose them jointly. 

- z,breaks well estimated if we know theta and phi!!!

1) aumentei diferenca entre common and rare species em fake data because results were so so before. Now it works well

2) Does it work when we set ncomm=10 when it should be ncomm=5? yes
